# This Fork
This is simply meant to be a port of [TheNexusAvenger's Overpowered Railgun](https://www.roblox.com/games/240720375/My-Overpowered-Railgun), into the [Innovation Security Railgun](https://www.roblox.com/library/7042600131/Innovation-Security-Railgun).

This is detached from the [original repository](https://github.com/Innovation-Inc-Roblox/Railgun) for purposes of restructuring, but will be kept up-to-date as much as possible with the original repository.

It is not planned for this project to be shared through Wally.

This is currently a work in progress.

Also, yes, I am aware the Rojo project file is an absolute mess, and so insanely structured. But it is needed that way, unless someone wants to pull request it to be better.
